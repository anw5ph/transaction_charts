# transaction_charts

This project was completed during my time as a research assistant with Dr. Dennie Kim in the University of Virginia Darden School of Business. 

The project pulls blockchain data regarding transactions using SQL querying on Dunes.com. From there, I exported the data as a csv file and created python files using NetworkX
and PyVis to create visualizations of the transaction nodes. The data was represented as a directed graph. In addition, I completed calculations regarding the number of 
nodes in the graph, number of edges, degree of each edge, eigenvector centrality of each node, etc. to incorpate additional analysis of the transaction data. 

In order to run this file on your local machine, download the repo and then run the `main.py` file.
